With over 10 years of experience in various domains, including mobile and desktop app development, web backend and frontend, hardware design, and image processing, I have a diverse range of skills that allow me to tackle any project.

Currently, I'm based in Tehran and looking for opportunities in Berlin. I am well versed in backend technologies such as Nest.js and Node.js in general, as well as Golang, Linux, and Docker. My experience in developing closed-source software has given me a unique perspective on how to approach projects, and I'm always eager to learn new things.

## Current Projects

My ultimate goal is to settle down in Berlin and have a stable and fulfilling life. I believe that technology can play a huge role in improving people's lives, and I am dedicated to using my skills to make a positive impact in the world.
